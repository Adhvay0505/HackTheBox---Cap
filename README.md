#  HackTheBox â€” Cap Walkthrough

## ðŸ§­ Enumeration

We'll begin by scanning all ports using **Nmap**. You can also use `rustscan` if you prefer speed.

### ðŸ“¡ Full TCP Nmap Scan

```bash
nmap -T4 -A -p- 10.10.10.245
```

```bash
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.245
Host is up (0.26s latency).
Not shown: 65531 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT     STATE SERVICE    VERSION

FTP(21), SSH(22), HTTP(80) ports are open on this machine,
lets check out the HTTP service

## IDOR
In the security snapshot section, we notice that the value of the `/data/id` increments everytime, this could mean we are able to view packet captures of other users. This is known as Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR), wherein a user can 
access data owned by another user

I tried `/data/0` and found multiple packets

We shall download the 0.pcap file and analyse it using wireshark

This part looks interesting, It seems to be a password to either FTP or SSH services
```bash
username: nathan
password: Buck3tH4TF0RM3!
```

I used the credentials for FTP and it worked!

It worked for SSH as well

now we have a shell in the system : D

the user flag in user.txt is in plain sight


## ðŸ’‚ Privelege Escalation

We shall use LinPeas.sh to escalate priveleges in this machine and gain root access, but LinPeas is not provided in the machine, hence I shall host it using a python http server on my Kali box and simply `cURL` it in the machine

Now we can `curl` it to the machine !

we take a look at the "Files with capabilities" section of the linpeas output and find this

![Screenshot From 2025-06-11 16-42-35](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb178f31-14c6-4403-a5da-6b821d0b0c44)

This lets us change UID to 0 i.e root

we run the python script with the following code:
``` bash
import os
os.setuid(0)
os.system("/bin/bash")
```

Now that we've gained root access, we shall move to the root dircetory and find the root flag!
